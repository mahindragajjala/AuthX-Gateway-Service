Project Title: AuthX Gateway Service
Idea Summary: Build a Golang-based authentication gateway that handles user 
              login, 
              registration, 
              and access to internal microservices using JWT, gRPC, and dual database storage (PostgreSQL + MongoDB).
Core Features:
            - REST + gRPC endpoints for login, signup, token refresh.
            - Role-based JWT authentication middleware.
            - PostgreSQL for storing user data.
            - MongoDB for session logging and audit trail.
            - Dockerized and ready for Kubernetes deployment.
