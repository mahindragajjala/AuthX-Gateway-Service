# AuthX Gateway Service
Developing:) 

## Project Overview

**AuthX Gateway Service** is a secure, scalable authentication gateway built in **Go (Golang)** that provides robust login, registration, and token-based access to microservices using modern tech stacks like **JWT**, **gRPC**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**.

The gateway acts as the **entry point** for users and services, enforcing authentication and authorization policies while supporting both REST and gRPC protocols.
